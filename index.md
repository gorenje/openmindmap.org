## Mapping Information Bubbles

Information bubbles are a natural extension of filter bubbles. We are placed inside a filter bubble by technology and begin to apply the very same implicit filters upon our own lives. We then enter the information bubble never noticing that we have boundaries to our knowledge.

Many speak of filter bubbles and a great deal of us suffer under them. Filter bubbles reduce our individual world view and our societal horizons. Little is written concerning how to identifying filter bubbles and even less is written on escaping them. Information bubbles are even worse as these grow out of the filter bubbles that surround us.

This article concerns itself with mapping information bubbles using mind maps and the fruitless efforts to escape information bubbles. mind maps are not street maps, making them an imperfect tool for escaping information bubbles. But what if there was another solution, another way out?

*What are filter bubbles?*

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble):

> A filter bubble or ideological frame is a state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalised searches when a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behaviour, and search history. As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. The choices made by these algorithms are only sometimes transparent. Prime examples include Google Personalised Search results and Facebook's personalised news-stream.

Filter bubbles arise out of the assumption that search engine make. Search engines believe that users wish not to be confronted with alternative ideas to their own. Which is good for the search engines since user will continue to use a search engine that confirms their ideas.

Filter bubbles get their name from the *filters* applied by search engines to prevent us from reading/interacting/accessing information that the search engine algorithm *believes* would be confrontational to us. This belief is based on our own behaviour, therefore it becomes a self-reinforcing vicious circle: we behave as we are expected and the search engines presents results so that we continue to behave in the same manner.

Our belief that search engines are an unbiased source of truth underlies this situation.

*What are information bubbles?*

Informational bubble is a consequence of filter bubbles being applied to our everyday life. Having been influenced by the filter bubble, we lower our expectation of critical thinking. We are surprised when thoughts and ideas appear that have not been been filtered away.

Informational bubbles are broader and reinforces our own personal filter bubbles, we apply the implicit rules of the search engine filter to our own lives. We begin to block out information that confronts us since this is what we have been taught happens on the Internet.

There are also [others](https://matthewrenze.com/articles/what-are-information-bubbles/) who have written on information bubbles and how to [escape them](https://matthewrenze.com/articles/escaping-your-information-bubble/).

*Technology is not to be blamed.*

Technology isn't to be blamed for our information bubbles, technology only reinforces what we, as humans naturally do. Being humans means living in an information bubble, else reality would overcome us.

Humans naturally have mental draws. Our minds can be pictured as a cupboard with many draws. Each draw represents a simplification we all make about our reality. Each drawer has a label and we are continually putting in and taking out of these draws.

The smallest bubbles we have are our mental concepts - "water", "colour", "tree", and so on - we would never question whether a tree might be a flower. We would never question that the liquid flowing down a stream is water. These informational bubbles help us to navigate the present and the environment around us.

As a species we started doing this to make our environment simpler to understand. If every time we encountered a stream and needed to understand the concept of water, we won't have gotten past the fifth stream.

We understood the concept of water and began to realise that it comes from the sky and flows along rivers. It freezes and melts and comes in many forms of ice. We don't differentiate between the snow we find in the Himalayans compare to the Alps, both are *specific* forms of snow but both fall under the same *concept* of snow.

We begin to generalise our environment and so that we aren't continually confronted with new and exciting discoveries: *that is a wheel and it has already been discovered* says the parent to the child upon discovering how a wheel turns.

Recognition is the first step to a cure, we all live in our information bubble and accepting that is the first step.

*Can bubbles be good?*

Filter bubbles do protect from confrontation with one owns intellectual boundaries - this can be painful and no one likes being confronted with ones own weakness. Ironically filter bubbles make us more sensitive to detecting and avoiding confrontational opinions and ideas.

For many information bubbles provide a safe space where nothing bad can happen. These are the spaces where we surround ourselves with like-minded others who one knows won't confront one. These spaces are wonderful but fragile. They can easily be disturbed by external forces. They are a type of labile space. A labile state is a steady state that when disturbed, will not return to the original state. On the other hand, a stable state is one that will return to its original steady state once disturbed.

Imagine a bowl with a marble in the bottom. Pushing the marble will move it around the bowl but eventually the marble will come to rest at its original position. That is a stable state. A labile state is turning the bowl around and place the marble at the peak of the bowl. The marble is a balanced steady state but when disturbed, the marble will roll down never to return to its original steady state at the peak of the bowl.

For us in our bubbles all is well until something disturbs this bubble. Once it has been disturbed, it will never be the same as before because of all the effort required to create it in the first place. This is fine and each to their own but it does ignore universal entropy.

*Information bubbles are entropy free zones.*

Entropy is the increase in randomness, the order goes against entropy. Imagine pouring hot water into a tub of cold water, the entropy increases as the hot water spreads throughout the tub giving the water an even temperature throughout but the molecules are more chaotic and dispersed.

Informational bubbles pretend that entropy does not happen, that disorder and chaos are outside the bubble and therefore will not affect the bubble. The bubble is stable and ordered and will remain that way forever - ideally. This is the Earth with its atmosphere in the Universe - ordered, stable and protected by a thin layer of gases. Except for the occasional meteor or astroid, we are all safe and contented here on spaceship Earth. The universe is unfortunately not stable and in fact is increasing in entropy. It is everything else then as we pretend it to be.

In the long run an information bubble will burst and that is a natural part of living, the external forces will one day break in. Just as children our parents protected us from things we were not meant to know. We then had sex education in school and finally we became parents ourselves. This is the cycle of human existence - without children, without information bubbles we won't be here.

*Are bubbles bad?*

Information bubbles have their place, as I have described we all have information bubbles and without them, we would be unable to cope with the complexity of existence.

The information bubbles that I would like to explore are those that are not as old and set as the concepts we have builtin from our natural surroundings. I would like to address the information bubbles that technology unknowingly creates around us. Protecting us from the controversial opinions that might bring us to develop new wisdoms and question the old wisdoms, expanding our intellectual horizons.

I am a believer in technology but technology should help us to expand our horizons and not tape it off - as police tape around a crime scene. My mobile phone is a hammer: it's there to do a job and just as a good hammer does not remind to hammer in some nails, so my mobile phone should not be telling me what to do. So for me, technology is a tool that should help me and not pretend it knows better.

Therefore I see technology based bubbles as over stepping the mark of a good tool which aids me to navigate life and existence.

*How to burst the bubble?*

There is no easy answer.

If the reader was hoping for a quick fix, a bandaid for information bubbles then I have to admit the reader will be disappointed.

Recognition is the first step as I wrote above. One think I have come to realise about information bubbles is that there are not signs saying: *don't go there*. Or doors marked with *do not enter here*. In short, the boundaries of our information bubbles are transparent and not signposted.

Instead what we can do is map out our information bubble, make a map of it. This is where I believe a mind map can help.

*Do we have the technology to burst the bubble?*

Wikipedia describes [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) as:

> A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information into a hierarchy, showing relationships among pieces of the whole. It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.

Take a blank piece of paper, write "life", put circle around it. Next to that circle, create a new circle but not connecting to the first circle. Write in this second circle "death" and then join the two circles with an arrow, going from life to death. One now has a mind map of the Western belief system. This is the only second simplest mind map, the first being a circle with "I" in the middle.

Expanding the principle and imagine creating a mind map with all your thoughts, fears, ideas, worries, intentions and beliefs as circles and connecting these with lines that have meaning for you. Imagine that the lines have no meaning other than there is a connection, be it a dependency or an influence or a feeling. Imagine being able to connect anything with anything else, there is enforced direction on connections. mind maps have an implicit direction out from a central concept. Other forms of mind maps exist, but for me, none have the flexibility that I am looking for to represent my mind.

When I speak of mind maps, I imagine an ad-hoc chaotic representation of my mind. Meaning that anything is allowed and everything can be connected. Connections have no meaning other than that they lead me to something else. For me it comes similar to doodling on a piece of paper, random doodles are created, expanded and replaced. Order and organisation comes later, meaning comes later, and interpretation is the final step.

*Can a mind map decompose a information bubble?*

Is it possible to pull yourself out of a hole by your hairs? This german phrase is a good representation of the problem of having a mind map. You can't pull yourself out by the hairs but you can look into a mirror. The mind map is that mirror.

The information bubble that is mapped when creating a mind map is just that: your information bubble. If you create an honest and truthful map of your ideas, thoughts and beliefs, a picture of your information bubble will be drawn. A mind map can provide a cartographic representation of your information bubble. You are then able to recognise the elements of your information bubble and the connections you believe connect those elements.

Unfortunately though, a mind map is not a street map or a map of a city. If you look a street map and know the area you are, you can navigate to somewhere were you have not been. Your mind map shows you your information bubble, you do not see what is missing in the image of your information bubble. And this is the hole that that we pull ourselves out of. Our information bubble tells us nothing about what else is out there.

*My learnings creating my own mind map.*

I found the tool and partly adapted to my needs but I can now create the mind map I imagined. Having gone through the exercise, I can only say that it is a lot of work and discipline. It remains an ongoing project, it will most certainly never be completed.

I have to admit I had a lot of source material. I meticulously write down all my thoughts and ideas, I keep a diary of these ideas and the events that lead up to them. Thankfully all of it was in electronic form. And it was this source material that actually led me to do this. I was faced with a one-dimensional world of writings, I no longer knew what was there. I needed a new representation, a two-dimensional representation. So it came that my mind map is a two-dimensional representations of my mind and writings, with reality becoming the three dimensional manifestation of my mind.

That is why the mind map I created was a bi-directional, multi-connecting chaotic collection of nodes, each with their own meaning but meaningless connections between them.

*Take the map, go forth and explore the unknown lands.*

As I described above, a mind map isn't a street map. I have spent a lifetime creating this amazingly complex information bubble in my head, how should I now find those unmapped streets, avenues or parks? How to move outside of the known areas of my mind.

Taking the analogy with street maps a step further. We have global street maps, [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/51.330/10.453) is a societally built and maintained map of the world. We have a societally built and maintained one-dimensional source of knowledge - Wikipedia. Would it not be a benefit to all to have an open collection of mind maps so we can all escape our own bubbles?

Combining mind maps from many will be represent a global atlas of knowledge, such as Wikipedia does in one-dimension, [openmindmap.org](https://openmindmap.org) would build those street map of human knowledge.

I imagine a site where you begin from your mind map and move along new connections to other mind maps from fellow astronauts on spaceship Earth. Because you begin in places you know - your own mind map - moving around from that knowledge space is a gentle confrontation with other thoughts and views.

As I move along my mind map paths, I will always encounter other paths that other people have taken, it is up to me to take those new paths, unexplored for me regions represent those places other have already been.

The irony of any such application would be that the underlying algorithms would implicitly create, if even somewhat larger, further information bubbles. This irony is not lost on the author.
